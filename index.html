    First you have to learn about what exactly a neuron is.
    Then how to form a neural network with the combination of bunch
    of those. Then try to understand what is the forward and the backward
    pass does.  
    Then you have to understand what is  a loss function, and how to           optimize your neural net with gradient descent, normalization and 
    regularization techniques.
